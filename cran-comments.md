## Resubmission

This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Fixed the DESCRIPTION file:
* Lowered the size of the package tarball
* Replaced all instances of FiveThirtyEight and 538 with `FiveThirtyEight`

## Test environments

* local OS X install, R 3.4.1
* win-builder (release)

## R CMD check results

There were no ERRORs, only two NOTES on package size.
