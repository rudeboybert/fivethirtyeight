<a href="#abstract" class="anchor"></a>Abstract</h1>
<p>As statistics and data science instructors, we often seek to use data in our courses that are rich, real, realistic, and relevant. To this end we created the fivethirtyeight R package of data and code behind the stories and interactives at the data journalism website FiveThirtyEight.com. After a discussion on the conflicting pedagogical goals of “minimizing prerequisites to research” (Cobb 2015) while at the same time presenting students with a realistic view of data as it exists “in the wild,” we articulate how a desired balance between these two goals informed the design of the package. The details behind this balance are embodied as our proposed “Tame data principles for introductory statistics and data science courses.” Details of the package’s construction and example uses are included as well.</p>
</div>
<div id="introduction" class="section level1">
<h1 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#introduction" class="anchor"></a>Introduction</h1>
<p>At the time of release of the <code>fivethirtyeight</code> package, the authors were all teaching in undergraduate settings, in particular introductory statistics, data science, quantitative methods, and business analytics courses. These courses were taught in a wide variety of settings for students coming from a diverse array of backgrounds, with each student having their own set of prior experience, requirements, and needs (see Biographies). Despite these variations, we agreed that there is a basic set of pedagogical principles that any introductory data-centric course should follow for it to truly serve the 21st century student. In particular, we agreed that such courses should revolve around the use of data that satisfy what we term the <em>3 R’s</em>. We want to use data that is</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>
<strong>Rich enough</strong> to answer meaningful questions with;</li>
<li>
<strong>Real enough</strong> to ensure that there is context;</li>
<li>
<strong>Realistic enough</strong> to convey to students that data as it exists “in the wild” often needs wrangling/pre-processing;</li>
</ol>
<p>It is against this backdrop that we present <code>fivethirtyeight</code>: an R package of data and code behind the stories and interactives at FiveThirtyEight. <a href="https://www.FiveThirtyEight.com">FiveThirtyEight.com</a> is a data-driven journalism website founded by Nate Silver and owned by Disney/ESPN that reports on politics, economics, sports, and other current events. FiveThirtyEight has been forward-thinking in making the data used in many of their articles open and accessible on their GitHub repository page <a href="https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data" class="uri">https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data</a> (GitHub is a web-based repository for collaboration on code and data). Our <code>fivethirtyeight</code> R package goes one step further by making this data and its corresponding documentation easily accessible, all with students in introductory statistics and data science courses that use R in mind. The homepage for the <code>fivethirtyeight</code> R package can be found at <a href="https://fivethirtyeight-r.netlify.app/" class="uri">https://fivethirtyeight-r.netlify.app/</a>.</p>
<div id="educational-landscape" class="section level2">
<h2 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#educational-landscape" class="anchor"></a>Educational Landscape</h2>
<p>The era of “Big Data” has led to renewed interest by the general public in the discipline of statistics. Given the increase in prominence of data-driven decision making in academia, industry, and government, there has been a corresponding increase in the number of statistics majors <span class="citation">(American Statistical Association Undergraduate Guidelines Workgroup 2014)</span>. In parallel with this growth, college administrators are pushing many new data science/data analytics education initiatives; this demand for data-centric education is forecasted to continue well into the future <span class="citation">(Manyika et al. 2011)</span>. Correspondingly, there has also been a rise in the availability and accessibility of laptop computers, open source statistical and computational tools, open source learning materials, and open data licenses. This has led to students being increasingly freed from the physical constraint of computer labs centered around desktop machines using proprietary commercial software, allowing them to work in physical settings and environments that they are more comfortable in. Additionally, given the open source nature of many new pedagogical tools, instruction manuals are increasingly being replaced with crowd-sourced approaches to help and documentation, such as GitHub and StackOverflow, opening up a wide world of support.</p>
<p>Statistics educators must capitalize on this renewed interest in the field, the rise of data science/analytics, and the increased availability and accessibility of technological tools to convey the importance of many critical statistical concepts to a new generation of students and practitioners, including distributions, sampling error, uncertainty, and modeling <span class="citation">(Cobb 2015; Nolan and Lang 2010; DeVeaux et al. 2016)</span>. In particular, one opportunity for experimentation with new pedagogical approaches, as espoused by the Guidelines for Assessment and Instruction in Statistics Education (GAISE), is to “integrate real data with a context and purpose” into the classroom <span class="citation">(GAISE College Report ASA Revision Committee 2016)</span>. Such integration of real datasets in the classroom has long had many advocates <span class="citation">(Gould 2010)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div id="two-conflicting-goals" class="section level2">
<h2 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#two-conflicting-goals" class="anchor"></a>Two Conflicting Goals</h2>
<p>One overarching goal we shared when designing courses is Cobb’s principle of “minimizing prerequisites to research” for students, where “research” in this context does not necessarily imply research suitable for publication in academic journals, but rather simply “answering questions with data” <span class="citation">(Cobb 2015)</span>. Cobb argues that students should be exposed to real and substantive data analysis as quickly as possible, even if this entails simplifying certain important topics at first and pushing aside others until later in the curriculum. Otherwise, Cobb argues we risk alienating a large number of students early on, thereby never allowing them to be exposed to the great potential of data analysis to answer questions on topics they may be curious about. This concept is further illustrated in what Grolemund and Wickham refer to as the “data/science pipeline” in Figure  <span class="citation">(Grolemund and Wickham 2017)</span>. We feel that it is important to expose students to all these elements of this statistical/data science analysis cycle, from data importation right through to the communication of the results, and not just certain portions of the pipeline as is often the case in many introductory courses.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="images/data_science_pipeline.png" alt="Grolemund and Wickham's 'Data/Science Pipeline'" width="75%"><p class="caption">
Grolemund and Wickham’s ‘Data/Science Pipeline’
</p>
</div>
<p>This thinking is in line with Perkins’ philosophy of “making learning more meaningful by teaching the ‘whole game’” instead of just isolated pieces of a discipline <span class="citation">(Perkins 2010)</span>. So just as how aspiring softball/baseball players first learn to play a simplified version of the game called “tee-ball” instead of only learning how to swing a bat, we feel that introductory statistics and data science students should be exposed to the entirety of the data/science pipeline early, even if only in a simplified form.</p>
<p>Another overarching goal we shared when designing courses is emphasizing the use of “real world” data. Dr. Jenny Bryan at the University of British Columbia and RStudio has famously quoted that traditional data used in the classroom is like a “teddy bear,” whereas real world data is more like a “grizzly bear with salmon blood dripping from its mouth” <span class="citation">(Jedamski 2015)</span>. To shield students from the wrangling and pre-processing necessary to prepare data for analysis is to ultimately do students a disservice, as we would be blinding them to the reality that many statisticians and data scientists spend a substantial amount of their time performing such tasks <span class="citation">(Lohr 2014)</span>.</p>
<p>These two goals, to ‘minimize prerequisites to research’ while also using real-world data, however, are in direct conflict with each other. On the one hand, one cannot expect novices to immediately tackle many raw datasets as they exist “in the wild,” thereby placing barriers to research at a time where there is high risk of alienating them. On the other hand, to present students with datasets that are overly curated would betray the true nature of the work done by statisticians and data scientists. We argue instead that a careful and thoughtful balance between these two goals is essential when preparing datasets for use in introductory statistics and data science courses.</p>
<p>As a means to this end we created the <code>fivethirtyeight</code> package, whose features and basic uses we present in Section 2. In Section 3 we present discussions on how we set the balance between these two goals and how this balance translated to the ultimate design of the package. These ideas are embodied in our proposed: <em>“Tame data” principles for introductory statistics and data science courses</em>.</p>

<div id="the-fivethirtyeight-r-package" class="section level1">
<h1 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#the-fivethirtyeight-r-package" class="anchor"></a>The <code>fivethirtyeight</code> R Package</h1>
<p>Many canonical datasets, such as <code>iris</code>, <code>UCBAdmissions</code>, Old <code>faithful</code>, and <code>anscombe</code>’s quartet have long been available for use in R. Other datasets, such as <code>mtcars</code> and <code>diamonds</code>, are used by many R packages as common examples to demonstrate the package’s functionality. More interestingly, many newer and larger datasets are included in R packages devoted exclusively to their dissemination, such as <code>nycflights13</code>, <code>babynames</code>, <code>gapminder</code>, and <code>okcupiddata</code> <span class="citation">(Horton, Baumer, and Wickham 2015; Wickham 2017a; Bryan 2015; Kim and Escobedo-Land 2015)</span>. Disseminating data via R packages has numerous advantages, in particular standardized web-based installation and relatively simple data-loading procedures.</p>
<p>Building off this precedent, we created the <code>fivethirtyeight</code> R package of data and code behind the stories and interactive visualizations at <a href="https://www.FiveThirtyEight.com">FiveThirtyEight.com</a>. All with the goal of providing the novice student a “low barrier to entry” to exploring datasets that satisfy the 3 R’s, we</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>
<strong>Made the data easy to load</strong>: All data is loaded from an R package, instead of through the importing of comma separated values (CSV) files, Excel spreadsheets, and other file formats.</li>
<li>
<strong>Made the data easy to understand</strong>: We provide ample documentation in the help file for each dataset, including:
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>A thorough description of the observational unit and all variables.</li>
<li>If documented, the data sources.</li>
<li>A link to the original article on FiveThirtyEight. We felt that inclusion of these links was critical to provide information on the data’s context, thereby emphasizing how “real” the data are.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Made the data easy to explore</strong>: We pre-process the data “just enough” to balance between the two conflicting goals from Section 1.2, thereby providing students access to data that is both “rich” and “realistic”, but not so much so that we run counter to the goal of “minimizing prerequisites to research.” We explicitly define what is meant by “just enough” in the Section 3: “Tame Data” Principles for Introductory Statistics and Data Science Courses.</li>
<li>
<strong>Made example data analyses easy to access and reproduce</strong>: We include crowd-sourced data analysis examples in <em>vignettes</em> written in R Markdown, available at <a href="https://fivethirtyeight-r.netlify.app/articles/" class="uri">https://fivethirtyeight-r.netlify.app/articles/</a>.</li>

<p>We demonstrate the most basic use of the package: viewing the contents of a dataset and opening its help file. As an example, we view the <code>bechdel</code> dataset and its corresponding help file, which contains a link to the original FiveThirtyEight article “The Dollar-And-Cents Case Against Hollywood’s Exclusion of Women” <span class="citation">(Hickey 2014b)</span>, a codebook describing all 15 variables, and other information.</p>

<div id="example-usage" class="section level2">
<h2 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#example-usage" class="anchor"></a>Example Usage</h2>
<p>We now present a more thorough example usage of the package, suitable for assignment in an introductory statistics or data science course, centering around the <code>hate_crimes</code> dataset used in the FiveThirtyEight article “Higher Rates Of Hate Crimes Are Tied To Income Inequality.” <span class="citation">(Majumder 2017)</span> In this article, the authors were interested in explaining the occurrence of hate crimes in the 50 US states and the District of Columbia based on demographic features of those states such as median income, education, and income inequality. In particular, they used multiple regression using both</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>
<code>hate_crimes_per_100k_splc</code>: the number of hate crimes per 100,000 individuals between November 9-18, 2016 as reported by the Southern Poverty Law Center</li>
<li>
<code>avg_hatecrimes_per_100k_fbi</code>: the average annual hate crime rate per 100,000 individuals between 2010 and 2015 as reported by the FBI</li>
</ol>
<p>as outcome variables. An example exercise would be to have students:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Read the original FiveThirtyEight article and any other necessary supplementary materials for context.</li>
<li>Look over the help file for the dataset to know what variables they have access to.</li>
<li>Perform an exploratory data analysis of the <code>hate_crimes</code> data by visually inspecting the raw values, computing summary statistics, and creating visualizations.</li>
<li>Run regressions with either of the above outcome variables to investigate which state-level demographic features are associated with hate crimes.</li>
<li>Summarize their findings in written form.</li>
</ol>
<p>We provide example solution code for this assignment using <code>hate_crimes_per_100k_splc</code> as the outcome variable and <code>gini_index</code> as the explanatory variable. The Gini index is a measure of income inequality where a value of 0 indicates perfect income equality and a value of 1 indicates perfect income inequality</p>
<p>First, have the students read the <code>hate_crimes</code> help file and look at the dataset’s raw values (note here the output is suppressed):</p>

<li>What is the Gini index? Students might not be familiar with this measure of income inequality, necessitating outside investigations (on Wikipedia for example).</li>
<li>What mechanisms generated the outcome variable? For example, how did the SPLC compute their counts as compared to the FBI? Are these counts based on <em>actual</em> numbers of hate crimes or <em>reported</em> numbers of hate crimes?</li>
<li>There were four states that did not have hate crimes measures (Hawaii, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wyoming) yielding four <code>NA</code> missing values. What is the nature of this missingness? Is there something particular about these four states?</li>
<li>The plot indicates one clear outlier in the relationship between hate crimes and income inequality. Upon further investigating this outlier can be identified as the District of Columbia (DC). What is different about DC when compared to the 50 states? Are their populations different? Does DC’s extremely small geographical area and urban nature answer this question?</li>
<li>The regression table suggests that there there is a positive association between hate crimes and income inequality. However, how much is this is driven by DC’s outlier value? Furthermore, what does the traditional interpretation of a slope coefficient <span class="math inline">\(b_1\)</span> (for every increase of 1 unit in <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, there is an associated increase of on average <span class="math inline">\(b_1\)</span> units of <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>) mean in this case when the Gini index itself is a value between 0 and 1? What might be a more informative interpretation of the slope coefficient?</li>

<p>The other component of the <code>fivethirtyeight</code> package is our use of package vignettes. Vignettes are included in many R packages as long-form guides and extended documentation to supplement existing help files <span class="citation">(Wickham 2015)</span>. In this package, we use vignettes not for documentation purposes, but as example data analyses based on the datasets included in the package. They are written in R Markdown, a notebook-style file format that weaves together narrative text and code to produce elegantly formatted output <span class="citation">(Allaire et al. 2017)</span>. Since the written text and source code are included in the same document, users can easily reproduce the analysis in its entirety.</p>
<p>In the article “The Dollar-And-Cents Case Against Hollywood’s Exclusion of Women” <span class="citation">(Hickey 2014b)</span> corresponding to the earlier introduced <code>bechdel</code> dataset, the authors describe a rough metric for evaluating the representation of women in a particular movie. A movie is described as passing the “Bechdel Test” if it satisfies the following criteria:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>There are at least two named female protagonists.</li>
<li>They talk to each.</li>
<li>They talk to each other about something other than a male protagonist.</li>
</ol>
<p>As described in the <code>bechdel</code> help file, the variable <code>title</code> identifies the movie while the variable <code>clean_test</code> displays the Bechdel Test rating, a categorical variable with five levels: <code>ok</code> (passes test), <code>dubious</code>, <code>men</code> (female protagonists only talk about male protagonists), <code>no talk</code> (female protagonists don’t talk to each other), and <code>nowomen</code> (fewer than two female protagonists). The vignette associated with this <code>bechdel</code> dataset is accessible by running:</p>

<p>In the spirit of balancing between the conflicting goals stated in Section 1.2, we propose the following <em>“Tame data” principles for introductory statistics and data science courses</em>. They are an explicit articulation of the guidelines we followed during the design of the <code>fivethirtyeight</code> R package, in particular the pre-processing we performed on the raw data available on the FiveThirtyEight GitHub repository page. The implementation of these principles removes some of the biggest barriers faced by novice students when first constructing basic data visualizations and performing rudimentary data wrangling, thereby “minimizing prerequisites for research.” However, their implementation does not simplify the datasets to the point that they no longer present students with a realistic view of data as it exists “in the wild.”</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>
<strong>Naming conventions for data frame and variable names</strong>:
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Whenever possible, all names should be no more than 20 characters long. Exceptions to this rule exist when shortening the names to less than 20 characters would lead to a loss of information.</li>
<li>Use only lower case characters and replace all spaces with underscores. This format is known as <code>snake_case</code> and is an alternative to <code>camelCase</code>, where successive words are delineated with upper case characters.</li>
<li>In the case of variable (column) names within a data frame, use underscores instead of spaces.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Variables identifying observational units</strong>:
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Any variables uniquely identifying each observational unit should be in the left-hand columns.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Dates</strong>:
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>If only a <code>year</code> variable exists, then it should be represented as a numerical variable.</li>
<li>If there are <code>year</code> and <code>month</code> variables, then convert them to <code>Date</code> objects as <code>year-month-01</code>. In other words, associate all observations from the same month to have a <code>day</code> of <code>01</code> so that a correct <code>Date</code> object can be assigned.</li>
<li>If there are <code>year</code>, <code>month</code>, and <code>day</code> variables, then convert them to <code>Date</code> objects as <code>year-month-day</code>.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Ordered Factors, Factors, Characters, and Logicals</strong>:
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Ordinal categorical variables are represented as <code>ordered</code> factors.</li>
<li>Categorical variables with a fixed and known set of levels are represented as regular <code>factor</code>s.</li>
<li>Categorical variables whose possible levels are either unknown or of a very large number are represented as <code>character</code>s.</li>
<li>Any “yes/no” character encoding of binary variables is converted to <code>TRUE/FALSE</code> logical variables.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Tidy data format</strong>:
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Whenever possible, save all data frames in “tidy” data format as defined by <span class="citation">Wickham (2014)</span>:
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Each variable forms a column.</li>
<li>Each observation forms a row.</li>
<li>Each type of observational unit forms a table.</li>

<li>If converting the raw data to “tidy” data format alters the dataset too much, then make the code to convert to tidy format easily accessible.</li>
</ol>

<p>By advocating for the shielding of novices from such pre-processing, we are not arguing for their diminished importance in a data scientist/statistician’s toolkit. Rather we argue that these are intermediate topics that should be left to later in the curriculum, either later in the same course or in a later course altogether. We have found in our experience that students are better motivated to learn such intermediate topics only after they have had a chance to develop basic data intuition and perform elementary data wrangling, visualization, modeling, and analysis. Furthermore, we note that while some of these principles are statistical language/software independent, many are specific to R and thus they should be viewed in the context of a course syllabus centered around the use of R. We present examples of four of these five principles in application and demonstrate the advantages they yield for novice R users, using both base R and <code>tidyverse</code>-centric approaches <span class="citation">(Wickham 2017d)</span>.</p>

<p>Whereas the first three subpoints relating to data frame and variable naming are more cosmetic in nature, the fourth principle relates to an R-specific issue faced by novices. Variable names that include spaces require different treatment than those that do not, specifically the use of tick marks when referring to them. While this is a topic R users eventually have to learn, we argue that it is not an immediate priority.</p>
<p>As an example of the importance of preprocessing variable names, consider the data corresponding to the FiveThirtyEight article “41 Percent Of Fliers Think You’re Rude If You Recline Your Seat” <span class="citation">(Hickey 2014a)</span> where survey respondents were asked, among other things, if 1) they considered it rude to bring a baby on a flight and 2) whether or not they had children under the age of 18. The raw data corresponding to this article is saved in CSV format on FiveThirtyEight’s GitHub repository page <a href="https://github.com/fivethirtyeight" class="uri">https://github.com/fivethirtyeight</a> and can be accessed via the shortened bit.ly link <a href="https://bit.ly/2vg8gTf" class="uri">https://bit.ly/2vg8gTf</a>. We load and save this in a data frame <code>flying_raw</code> and look at the first 5 variable names:</p>

#&gt; [5] "Do you have any children under 18?"</code></pre>
<p>We contrast this to the corresponding <code>flying</code> data frame in the <code>fivethirtyeight</code> package:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb12"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">

<p>We see that in the latter case the variable names are much shorter and cleaner. This simplification leads to much less cumbersome code to wrangle and visualize this data. For example, consider the following two <code><a href="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggplot.html">ggplot()</a></code> commands to generate the barplot in Figure  to visualize the relationship between the two categorical variables of interest: using the raw data necessitates tick marks to access the variables, whereas using the latter data doesn’t.</p>

<p>Although recent advances such as the <code>lubridate</code> package have made wrangling dates much easier, performing such tasks can still be very challenging for students who have not had experience <span class="citation">(Grolemund and Wickham 2011)</span>. In datasets where only a numerical variable indicating the year exists, it can be argued no pre-processing is necessary. However, when a month and/or day variables exist along with a year variable, we argue that pre-processing should be done. Specifically, they should be combined and converted to <code>Date</code> objects. This allows for easy creation of time series plots with well formatted x-axes and for performing of basic date arithmetic.</p>
<p>As an example of the importance of preprocessing dates, consider the data corresponding to the FiveThirtyEight article “Some People Are Too Superstitious To Have A Baby On Friday The 13th” <span class="citation">(Bialik 2016)</span> of the number of daily births in the United States between 1994 and 2003. The raw data corresponding to this article is saved in CSV format on FiveThirtyEight’s GitHub repository page <a href="https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/" class="uri">https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/</a> and can be accessed via the shortened bit.ly link <a href="https://bit.ly/2vgRFiw" class="uri">https://bit.ly/2vgRFiw</a>. We load this data, filter for only those rows corresponding to 1999 births, and save this in a data frame <code>US_births_1999_raw</code>. The raw data is saved in a format that makes it difficult for novices to create a time series plot. Furthermore, people do not typically think of the day of the week (Sunday, Monday, etc) in terms of a numerical value between 1 and 7.</p>

<p>Much as the FiveThirtyEight article suggested that there are relatively fewer births on Fridays that fall on the 13th because many parents avoid inducing labor on that date for likely superstitious reasons, a plausible explanation for the spike of births on 9/9/99 is that parents were choosing to deliberately induce labor on that date given its aesthetic appeal.</p>

<a href="#factors-vs-characters" class="anchor"></a>Factors vs Characters</h2>
<p>In our experience, among the earliest questions students pose when creating data visualizations involving a categorical variable (such as barplots and boxplots) is “How do I reorder the bars/boxes?” This is because the default alphabetical ordering of a categorical variable is often not intuitive. While there have been many recent advances in dealing with factor variables in R such as the <code>forcats</code> package <span class="citation">(McNamara and Horton 2017; Wickham 2017b)</span>, we argue that the reordering of categorical variables is still sufficiently too complex for novices that it would run counter to Cobb’s philosophy of “minimizing prerequisites to research.” Rather, we suggest that this topic should only be addressed after students have developed a basic familiarity with R. Therefore when pre-processing the datasets for this package, we represented ordinal categorical variables as <code>ordered</code> factors with the appropriate levels, categorical variables with a fixed and known set of levels as regular <code>factor</code>s, and categorical variables whose possible levels are either unknown or of a very large number as <code>character</code>s.</p>
<p>As an example of the importance of preprocessing categorical variables, consider again the data corresponding to the FiveThirtyEight article “The Dollar-And-Cents Case Against Hollywood’s Exclusion of Women” <span class="citation">(Hickey 2014b)</span> of Bechdel Test scores of gender representation for various movies. This article includes Figure , showing the breakdown of Bechdel Test results for movies in 5-year time periods. A key observation is that within each bar corresponding to a 5-year time period, the vertical ordering of the blue and red segments matches the hierarchical nature of the five possible Bechdel Test outcomes. For example, the question of whether female protagonists talk about something other than male protagonists is only relevant if the movie has more than two women and the women speak to each other.</p>

<div id="tidy-data-format" class="section level2">
<h2 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#tidy-data-format" class="anchor"></a>Tidy Data Format</h2>
<p>Whenever possible, we saved data frames in “tidy” data format <span class="citation">(Wickham 2014)</span>. Wickham describes a dataset/data frame as being in tidy format if it satisfies the following criteria:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Each variable must have its own column.</li>
<li>Each observation must have its own row.</li>
<li>Each type of observational unit forms a table.</li>
</ol>
<p>This format is also known as “long/narrow” format, as opposed to “wide” format. While the information contained in a dataset is identical irrespective of it being in “tidy” format or not, the chief benefit of these format guidelines is that they act as a set of standards for the input and output format of many different functions in many different R packages, in particular those in the <code>tidyverse</code> suite of R packages for data science. These guidelines are espoused in the first principle of the “tidy tools manifesto” to “reuse existing data structures” <span class="citation">(Wickham 2017c)</span>. By following this formatting guideline, all datasets in the <code>fivethirtyeight</code> package fit seamlessly into the <code>tidyverse</code> ecosystem of R packages, in particular the <code>ggplot2</code> package for data visualization and the <code>dplyr</code> package for data wrangling.</p>
<p>Converting datasets to “tidy” format in R necessitates understanding of the <code><a href="https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/reference/gather.html">gather()</a></code> and <code><a href="https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/reference/spread.html">spread()</a></code> commands of the <code>tidyr</code> package. We argue that the topic of converting between wide data format and tidy/long format is best left to an intermediate stage of learning, given the relative complexity of the necessary commands. Therefore we pre-processed all data in the package to follow the tidy data format. For datasets where we felt converting the data to tidy format would alter them too much from their original form, we include the <code><a href="https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/reference/gather.html">gather()</a></code> code necessary to convert them from wide data format to tidy format in the <code>@examples</code> section of the corresponding help files.</p>
<p>For example, say we want to create a barplot comparing consumption of beer, spirits, and wine between the United States and France using the <code>drinks</code> dataset corresponding to the article “Dear Mona Followup: Where Do People Drink The Most Beer, Wine And Spirits?” <span class="citation">(Chalabi 2014)</span> The data is saved in “wide” format and thus cannot be used in the <code><a href="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggplot.html">ggplot()</a></code> function.</p>

<p>One immediate application of this package for instructors is to increase the data-centricism of their courses with minimal disruption to the syllabus. The data are easy to load via an R package and the help files contain contextual information, including a description of all variables and a link to the original article. For courses with a data science component, the datasets can provide students opportunities to “flex their data science muscles,” in particular those relating to data visualization and wrangling. For example, Ismay had their SOC 301 Social Statistics students at Pacific University use these datasets for their group projects, which can be accessed at <a href="https://ismayc.github.io/soc301_s2017/" class="uri">https://ismayc.github.io/soc301_s2017/</a>. Finally, as stated in Section 2.3, for courses where data wrangling is a learning goal in and of itself, the source code converting the raw data to tame data format can be used as examples for students to learn more sophisticated data wrangling tools, such as those needed to wrangle dates and strings/text data.</p>
<p>Additionally, this package is being used in other statistics and data science pedagogical initiatives. Ismay and Kim have incorporated this package into “ModernDive: An Introduction to Statistical and Data Sciences via R” <span class="citation">(Ismay and Kim 2017a)</span>, an open source, fully reproducible electronic textbook available at <a href="https://www.moderndive.com" class="uri">https://www.moderndive.com</a>. Ismay is creating a companion DataCamp course “Effective Data Storytelling Using the <code>tidyverse</code>” <span class="citation">(Ismay and Kim 2017b)</span>; DataCamp is an online interactive environment for learning data science currently via R and Python.</p>
