# fivethirtyeight 0.5.0

* Added vignette corresponding to Technology Innovations in Statistics Education [paper](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/0rx1231m#main)
* Removed tidyverse from `DESCRIPTION` Depends, Imports, or Suggests fields
* Added `state_info` data frame of state name, abbreviation, US census division/region
* Added `state_abbrev` variable to `hate_crimes` dataset so that 
users can plot state abbreviations via `geom_text(aes(label = state_abbrev))`
instead of using less informative `geom_point()`
* Given CRAN package size restrictions, the following datasets only consist of a preview of the first 10 rows of the entire dataset: `comic_characters`, `goose`, `house_district_forecast`, `mlb_elo`, `nba_carmelo`, `nfl_elo`, `ratings`, `senators`, and `spi_matches`. Code to load the entire dataset are provided in the respective help file examples.

* Package website now at <http://fivethirtyeight-r.netlify.com/>
* Added new data sets:
    + By Meredith Manley: `ahca_polls`, `bachelorette`, `candy_rankings`, 
    `chess_transfers`, `generic_polllist`, `generic_topline`, 
    `mayweather_mcgregor_tweets`, `mlb_elo`, `ratings`, `spi_global_rankings`,

* Note for now `mayweather_mcgregor_tweets`, `mlb_elo`, `nba_carmelo`,
`nfl_elo`, `senators`, only include the first 10 rows of the data because of R
package file size restrictions (< 5MB tarballs); code to download/process the
entire dataset are included in help files. We hope to include full versions of
these datasets in v0.5.0 of package using the `drat` package.
* Converted all ordinal categorical variables to `factor(..., ordered = TRUE)`.
Ex: `bechdel$clean_test`
* Vignette notes:
    + Added a vignette that has a link to all user-contributed vignettes, which 
    are only available on development version of package and on GitHub due to 
    CRAN package size restrictions.
    + For all datasets that have a user contributed vignette, add a link to it 
    in the corresponding help/roxygen code file.
* Added `CITATION`

restrictions. Other crowd-sourced analysis vignettes still available
    + In development version
    + On package website under "Articles" <http://fivethirtyeight-r.netlify.com/>
* Other minor changes:
    + Fixed levels in `bechdel$clean_test` and `bechdel$test` to match
